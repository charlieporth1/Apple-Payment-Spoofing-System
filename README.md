# Apple-Payment-Spoofing-System
Apple Payment Spoofing System. Using Firebase and a private server to trigger backend app changes to navigate around IAP because I hate apple. No longer maintaned or used as this Project Let apple to change there policies to ban an app that does this because of this project that policy was created
[Changes Link](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#introduction:~:text=by%20trying%20to%20trick%20the%20review%20process)
```
If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developerâ€™s work, manipulate ratings or App Store discovery) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.
```
This would turn off IAP (In app purchaese) when the app was in review and turn them on when it got out
